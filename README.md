# Fast Eigensolver: High-Speed Eigendecomposition for Banded Laplacian Matrices

## Input Specifications
- Matrix Type: Symmetric Laplacian matrices from undirected, locally connected graphs
- Values: Integer-valued entries
- Size: N×N
- Bandwidth: b (matrix has b non-zero diagonals above main diagonal)
- Sparsity: Maximum of 2bN + N non-zero elements
- Properties:
  * Main diagonal contains positive integers (degree of each vertex)
  * Off-diagonals contain -1 or 0 only (connectivity)
  * Row sums are zero (Laplacian property)
  * All eigenvalues are real and non-negative (positive semi-definite)

## Matrix Structure Exploitation
- Store only upper triangular part (due to symmetry)
- Each diagonal stored at its natural length:
  * Main diagonal: length N
  * First off-diagonal: length N-1
  * k-th off-diagonal: length N-k
- No padding or normalization (preserve integer structure)
- Total storage: (b+1) vectors of decreasing length
- Additional structural properties to exploit:
  * Eigenvalue interlacing between principal submatrices
  * Bandwidth preservation under orthogonal transformations
  * Trace equals sum of eigenvalues equals sum of diagonal entries
  * Integer determinant (useful for error checking)

## Neural Architecture

### 1. Diagonal Encoder Network
- Separate 1D CNN for each diagonal with adaptive architecture:
  * Kernel sizes scale with bandwidth: min(max(3, b/4), 11)
  * Channel width scales with diagonal importance
- Input sizes decrease with diagonal number:
  * Main diagonal: 1 × N
  * k-th diagonal: 1 × (N-k)
- Architecture per diagonal:
  * Conv1D(in=1, out=64, kernel=adaptive) → Structure-Preserving-ReLU
  * Conv1D(in=64, out=128, kernel=adaptive) → Structure-Preserving-ReLU
  * Conv1D(in=128, out=256, kernel=adaptive) → Structure-Preserving-ReLU
- Structure-preserving features:
  * Integer-aware activation functions
  * Position encoding relative to diagonal position
  * Bandwidth-aware feature extraction
  * Skip connections preserving structural information
- No padding (preserve length reduction)
- No batch normalization (integer inputs)
