# Fast Eigensolver: Band-Limited Neural Architecture for Laplacian Matrices

## Input Specifications

The eigensolver operates on a specialized class of matrices derived from graph theory. These matrices must be symmetric Laplacian matrices that originate from undirected, locally connected graphs. The system processes matrices of dimension N×N, where the bandwidth parameter b defines the count of non-zero diagonals above the main diagonal.

Key matrix properties:
- Matrix entries must be integer-valued
- Main diagonal contains positive integers representing vertex degrees
- Off-diagonal elements are constrained to {-1, 0}
- Row sums equal zero (Laplacian property)
- Spectrum is real and non-negative (positive semi-definite)

## Matrix Structure Exploitation

The system employs an efficient storage scheme that capitalizes on matrix symmetry. Rather than storing the full N×N matrix, we maintain only the upper triangular portion through a series of vectors with naturally decreasing lengths. This approach eliminates redundancy while preserving the integer structure of the input.

Storage organization:
- Main diagonal: Full length N vector
- First off-diagonal: Length N-1 vector
- k-th off-diagonal: Length N-k vector
- Total storage: b+1 vectors of decreasing length

## Neural Architecture

### Band-Limited Encoder Network

The encoder implements a parallel processing approach optimized for GPU computation. Each diagonal receives specialized processing through dedicated convolutional paths with dimensions scaled to preserve necessary information capacity.

Channel architecture:
- Main diagonal: 1→64 channels (primary information carrier)
- First three off-diagonals: 1→32 channels
- Remaining diagonals: 1→16 channels

This channel structure ensures sufficient capacity for eigenspace information while maintaining computational efficiency. All convolutional kernels employ a fixed size of min(b,5), ensuring operations remain strictly within the banded structure.

Input processing:
- Main diagonal: Processes full length N
- k-th diagonal: Natural length N-k
- No padding or artificial extension
- Parallel processing of all diagonals on GPU

Structural preservation:
- ReLU-based activation functions preserving non-negativity
- Position encoding capturing bandwidth structure
- Skip connections maintaining direct pathways
- Zero row sum constraints actively enforced
- Integer relationship preservation through specialized layers
