# Fast Eigensolver: Band-Limited Neural Architecture for Laplacian Matrices

## Input Specifications

The eigensolver operates on a specialized class of matrices derived from graph theory. These matrices must be symmetric Laplacian matrices that originate from undirected, locally connected graphs. The system processes matrices of dimension N×N, where the bandwidth parameter b defines the count of non-zero diagonals above the main diagonal.

Key matrix properties:
- Matrix entries must be integer-valued
- Maximum sparsity pattern of 2bN + N non-zero elements
- Main diagonal contains positive integers representing vertex degrees
- Off-diagonal elements are constrained to {-1, 0}
- Row sums equal zero (Laplacian property)
- Spectrum is real and non-negative (positive semi-definite)

## Matrix Structure Exploitation

The system employs an efficient storage scheme that capitalizes on matrix symmetry. Rather than storing the full N×N matrix, we maintain only the upper triangular portion through a series of vectors with naturally decreasing lengths. This approach eliminates redundancy while preserving the integer structure of the input.

Storage organization:
- Main diagonal: Full length N vector
- First off-diagonal: Length N-1 vector
- k-th off-diagonal: Length N-k vector
- Total storage: b+1 vectors of decreasing length

The system exploits several fundamental mathematical properties that enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Eigenvalues exhibit interlacing relationships between principal submatrices, providing valuable constraints for the neural architecture. The bandwidth remains preserved under orthogonal transformations, allowing for consistent processing throughout the network. The trace of the matrix equals both the sum of eigenvalues and the sum of diagonal entries, providing important validation checks.

## Neural Architecture

### Band-Limited Encoder Network

The encoder represents a significant departure from traditional architectures by implementing a narrow-channel approach. Each diagonal receives specialized processing through dedicated convolutional paths with strictly limited dimensions.

Channel architecture:
- Main diagonal: 1→16 channels (primary information carrier)
- First three off-diagonals: 1→8 channels
- Remaining diagonals: 1→4 channels

This dramatic reduction in channel width, compared to traditional architectures using hundreds of channels, maintains essential structural information while significantly reducing computational complexity. All convolutional kernels employ a fixed size of min(b,5), ensuring operations remain strictly within the banded structure.

Input processing remains bandwidth-aware:
- Main diagonal: Processes full length N
- k-th diagonal: Natural length N-k
- No padding or artificial extension

The network preserves structural integrity through specialized components:
- Integer-aware activation functions maintain value relationships
- Position encoding captures location within bandwidth
- Skip connections preserve direct structural pathways
- Parallel processing of all diagonals on GPU
- Zero row sum constraint maintenance

### Band-Aware Fusion Network

The fusion network processes band-limited features while maintaining strict structural properties. Input consists of b+1 feature maps, each with maximum dimension 16, representing a significant reduction from traditional architectures using 256 or more features. 

The network performs three key operations:
1. Local feature grouping respecting bandwidth constraints
2. Structure-preserving merge operations maintaining Laplacian properties
3. Band-limited attention mechanisms operating within b-width

Output characteristics:
- 32×b feature matrix (reduced from traditional 512×N)
- Preserved zero row sum property
- Maintained bandwidth structure
- Conserved integer relationships

### Direct Eigendecomposition Network

The system implements direct eigendecomposition through a band-limited approach, avoiding the traditional costly expansion to N×N dimensions. This network processes the 32×b feature matrix to produce eigenvalues and eigenvectors simultaneously.

Structural constraints enforced during computation:
- Non-negativity of eigenvalues
- Orthogonality of eigenvectors
- Bandwidth preservation
- Integer relationship maintenance
